        title: "Genomics Research Collaborative "
        content: We welcome interested students, residents and faculty to join our
          Genomics Research Collaborative (GRC). GRC gathers student researchers
          with an interest in computational genomics, basic science, and
          clinical research related to genetics. We promote various types of
          research collaboration, including support of advanced research
          training, sharing of genomics data, assistance in capstone projects,
          co-authoring publications, and presenting at scientific meetings.

        title: Mentoring
        content: We serve to link students interested in genomics and personalized
          medicine to mentors in research and clinical practice working not only
          in medical genetics and genomics but also in a variety of other fields
          that intersect with genetics. These include general internal medicine,
          pediatrics, oncology, neurosurgery, psychiatry, ob/gyn, and others.
